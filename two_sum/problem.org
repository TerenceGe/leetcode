#+TITLE: [[https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/][Two Sum]]

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC js

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

#+END_SRC

UPDATE (2016/2/13):
The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.

solution:

#+BEGIN_SRC c++

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {

    }
};

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC js

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {

};

#+END_SRC
